# Naive-Bayes
Project Title: Spam and Ham Detection Using Naive Bayes
Project Overview:
The project focuses on building an email classification system that can automatically categorize incoming emails as either spam or ham (non-spam) using the Naive Bayes algorithm. This system helps filter out unwanted emails and prioritize important messages, enhancing email management and user experience.


Objective:
To develop a machine learning model using the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify emails based on their content as spam or ham. The model will be trained on a labeled dataset of emails and will learn to predict the likelihood of an email being spam based on the presence of specific words and phrases.


Key Features:
Text Preprocessing: The raw email content will be preprocessed by removing stop words, stemming, and tokenization to prepare the data for the Naive Bayes classifier.
Feature Extraction: Bag-of-words or Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) techniques will be used to convert email text into numerical features.
Model Training: The Naive Bayes classifier (either Multinomial or Bernoulli) will be trained on labeled email datasets.
Model Evaluation: The classifier's performance will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Handling Imbalanced Data: Techniques such as undersampling, oversampling, or adjusting class weights will be used to address any class imbalance in the dataset.


Use Cases:
Email Filtering: Automatically sort emails into spam and ham folders.
Improved User Experience: Reduce the number of unwanted emails reaching users' inboxes.
Email Security: Prevent phishing and other malicious emails from reaching users.
